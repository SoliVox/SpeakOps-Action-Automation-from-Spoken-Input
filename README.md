# SpeakOps-Action-Automation-from-Spoken-Input
SpeakOps transforms spoken voice notes into automated actions. Using a custom SpeakSpace Action, it processes note text, extracts key details, and triggers workflows like task updates, content generation, or system actions—turning everyday speech into fast, efficient automation.
